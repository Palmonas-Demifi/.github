## 👋 What we are about

PALMONAS is a jewellery brand built for everyday luxury. We design demi-fine jewellery with premium materials — 18k thick gold plating, sterling silver, surgical-steel bases — so you get high-quality pieces you can actually wear, not lock away.
Our pieces are made to *move with you*, not sit in a box.

## 🍿 Fun facts

* Our jewellery is endorsed / co-designed by actress Shraddha Kapoor — she helped build the brand’s aesthetic of “modern minimalism meets real-life wearability”.
* We strongly believe jewellery shouldn’t be reserved only for “special occasions” — it’s for daily wear, layering, stacking, working, partying, living.
* We call our category “demi-fine” — right between fine jewellery (solid gold) and fast fashion. This gives you great style + durability at a better price.

## 🧭 Why we stand out

* **Material quality**: 18k gold vermeil, thick gold tone plating over sterling silver or surgical steel, lab-grown diamonds when used.
* **Skin-safe & everyday friendly**: Hypoallergenic, no nickel/brass; designed to handle showers, workouts, all-day wear.
* **Lifestyle-centric design**: Not just pretty — functional, durable, wearable. Thoughtful design details for real life.
* **Modern yet meaningful**: From minimalist mangalsutra alternatives to stackable rings, we blend tradition + trend.
